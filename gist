   "description":"“The red string is tangling, but binding,” or so they say.\n\n

Despite being betrothed by their parents, these two do NOT get along. They curse one another whenever they’re face to face, but their true feelings? Completely the opposite. The two, who just can’t be honest, assume that “I bet he/she only cares about himself/herself” – but they might actually love each other?! \n\n

Seriously, why can’t they just be married? Because they already are? Soon that is!",
